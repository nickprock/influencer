# Influencer Centrality

The algorithm in this package is inspired about the paper **"Detecting Topic Authoritative Social Media Users: a
Multilayer Network Approach"**.
In this paper, the authors propose a method capable to find influential users by exploiting the contents of the messages posted by them to express opinions on items, by modeling these contents with a three-layer network.

The [full paper](http://staff.icar.cnr.it/pizzuti/pubblicazioni/IEEETM2017.pdf) and [other materials](http://staff.icar.cnr.it/pizzuti/codice/SocialAU/readme.html) are avaible on [*ICAR-CNR*](https://www.icar.cnr.it/) website.

I try to develop an algorithm like **SocialAU** using [**JAX**](https://github.com/google/jax) and [**NumPy**]() for calculations between tensors.

## Other Functions

The package contains others centrality measure like:
* [HITS and TOPHITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm)
* [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) [not avaible now]

## Test

I tested the performance about **JAX** on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c7CFyuKYpV8Ngf5RrUAyp1DZf-qYiQVv).

At the moment numpy work better than JAX but I may have made some mistakes (the reason could be [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51177788/cupy-is-slower-than-numpy)). **Please report it in the issues.**


**The library allows you to use both versions.**
